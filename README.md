This project is a fully-functional algorithmic market-making trading bot built for the Kalshi prediction market platform. Its primary goal is to provide dual-sided liquidity (bids and asks) on Kalshi markets to capture the bid-ask spread while actively managing inventory risk.

## System Overview

* **Compute:** Managed container execution via Docker and Docker Compose running on a 24/7 DigitalOcean Droplet.
* **Database:** Relational order logs and execution history persisted via a PostgreSQL container.
* **Observability:** Telemetry captured via Grafana Alloy and pushed to a hosted Grafana Cloud instance.
* **Alerting:** Real-time error alerts and critical status updates broadcasted to Discord or Slack via webhooks.

## System Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the core trading loop, the PostgreSQL database, DigitalOcean cloud resources, and external observability and alerting components:

## Deployment & Infrastructure

The server infrastructure and security policies are defined using Terraform and hardened using Docker best practices.

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
The `infra` directory contains configuration to spin up the DigitalOcean Droplet, VPC, and firewalls:
*   **VPC Isolation:** The Droplet is placed inside a dedicated private network.
*   **Egress Filtering:** The firewall strictly blocks all outbound ports except `53` (DNS), `443` (HTTPS/WSS to Kalshi and GitHub), and `123` (NTP).
*   **Inbound Protection:** SSH (Port 22) is restricted to your trusted IP ranges. The metrics port (`8000`) is closed to the public internet.

### Docker Hardening & Security
The runtime environment is hardened to ensure a secure production footprint:
*   **Multi-Stage Build:** The Dockerfile compiles all dependencies in a builder container, leaving the final production image clean of compilers like `gcc`.
*   **Non-Root User:** The container runs under a dedicated, low-privilege system user named `trader`.
*   **Healthchecks:** Both PostgreSQL and the trading bot utilize Docker container healthchecks to monitor initialization status and API metrics endpoints automatically.
*   **Local Port Binding:** The Prometheus metrics port is bound strictly to the local loopback interface (`127.0.0.1:8000:8000`), making it inaccessible over the public IP of the Droplet.

### Database Backups
The project includes an automated backup pipeline for the PostgreSQL database containing order execution history. 

Backups are saved to `/root/backups/kalshi-bot/` on the host, and local backups older than 7 days are automatically pruned to prevent disk bloat.

### DigitalOcean Backups
In addition to database-level logical backups, daily full-system snapshots are enabled at the cloud provider level in DigitalOcean for the Droplet. This serves as a disaster recovery safety net to restore the entire operating system, code repository, and configuration files in the event of hardware or virtual machine failure.


## Configuration Parameters

The following parameters customize the bot's trading strategy, risk limits, and database connections. They are loaded dynamically on startup from the `.env` file or the system environment:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `KALSHI_ENV` | `string` | `prod` | Kalshi environment connection mode (`demo` or `prod`). Defaults to `prod`; `.env.example` intentionally sets `demo` for safer local onboarding. |
| `TARGET_TICKER` | `string` | - | The market ticker code to quote (e.g., `INX-26AUG-T5700`). |
| `ORDER_SIZE` | `integer` | `1` | Number of contracts to trade per quote side. |
| `MIN_SPREAD` | `integer` | `4` | The minimum profit margin spread (in cents) required to quote. |
| `RISK_GAMMA` | `float` | `0.05` | Inventory risk aversion parameter. Higher values skew prices faster. |
| `DB_HOST` | `string` | `localhost` | Host address of the PostgreSQL database instance. |
| `DB_PORT` | `integer` | `5432` | Port number of the PostgreSQL database. |
| `DB_NAME` | `string` | `kalshi_bot` | Name of the database schema. |
| `DB_USER` | `string` | `postgres` | Username for database authentication. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `string` | `postgres` | Password for database authentication. |


## Secrets Management with Doppler

In production, the bot does not store plaintext `.env` configurations or private `.pem` keys on the Droplet host disk. Instead, it utilizes **Doppler** to inject all parameters and keys directly into memory on startup.

### Automated Setup & Deployment
The installation and configuration of Doppler on the Droplet is **fully automated** via the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. 

To enable this integration, the only Doppler-specific requirement is to register your Service Token in your GitHub Repository Secrets (in addition to your standard server deployment secrets like `DROPLET_IP` and `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`):
* Name: **`DOPPLER_TOKEN`**
* Value: your Doppler production service token (starts with `dp.st.prd.`)

Once the secret is added, pushing to `main` will automatically build the images, verify dependencies, install Doppler on the target server, configure authentication, and launch the bot.


## Live Output Preview
